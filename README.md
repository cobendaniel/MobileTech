Methodology:
 - Two types of data, namely environmental data and energy usage were used during the research process
  1. Environmental data: Temperature and humidity data collected from IOT devices and nearby weather stations, with data being separated by time of day into five different parts. 
  2. Energy usage data: 10 minute intervals using m-bus meters
  
Data preparation and modelling
 - Raw data from online sources were preprocessed to match the main dataset's time intervals of 10 minutes. 
 - Derivative variables were created in order to better assess usage patterns
 - The paper used Principal Component Analysis and F-Test Analysis to choose attributes as predictors
 - Min-max scaling was applied in order to ensure that models would not have a problem with scaling
 - SVR and Back propagated neural networks were evaluated.
